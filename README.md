## ðŸ“š What I Learned

While building this extension, I gained deeper experience with:

### ðŸ”— Saving the current tab

```js
tabBtn.addEventListener("click", function () {
  chrome.tabs.query({ active: true, currentWindow: true }, function (tabs) {
    myLeads.push(tabs[0].url);
    localStorage.setItem("myLeads", JSON.stringify(myLeads));
    render(myLeads);
  });
});

### ðŸ§¾ Rendering leads with template strings
function render(leads) {
  let listItems = "";
  for (let i = 0; i < leads.length; i++) {
    listItems += `<li>
      <a target="_blank" href="${leads[i]}">
        ${leads[i]}
      </a>
    </li>`;
  }
  ulEl.innerHTML = listItems;
}
